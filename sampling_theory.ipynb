    "* Let $s(t)$ a band-width limited signal, with maximum frequency component $f_\\text{m}$ Hz. The Sampling Theorem says that, in order to sample $s(t)$, $2f_\\text{m}$ samples per second must taken.  $2f_\\text{m}$ is known as the Nyquist Frequency.\n",

    "### Proof\n",

    "* According to the statement, we have that $S(\\omega)=0$ when $|\\omega|>\\omega_\\text{m}$ (it is limited in band), where $\\omega_\\text{m}=2\\pi f_\\text{m}$ is the maximum angular frequency of $s(t)$.\n",
